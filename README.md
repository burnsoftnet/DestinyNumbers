# DestinyNumbers

You can also use the science of numbers to determine your destiny, or life goal, according to your given birth name: First, Middle and last.  However, if you have rejected your birth name in favor of another name, both names should be considered as forces that shape you and your life. 

The Destiny number is determined by assigning a numerical value to each letter, adding the numbers together, then reducing them to a single number.  Numbers eleven and twenty-two, however, are not reduced, as they have special significance of their own.

Even then, its always fun to see if it matches up with your personality or someone you know.
